Javascript executor is an interface that is used in places where the normal webdriver interface cannot be used
We r using this because in some case java doesnt have the access to the DOM structure but javascript has the access

JavaScriptExecutor is an Interface that helps to execute JavaScript through Selenium Webdriver. 
JavaScriptExecutor provides two methods “executescript” & “executeAsyncScript” to run javascript on the selected window or current page.

Why do we need JavaScriptExecutor?
*In Selenium Webdriver, locators like XPath, CSS, etc. are used to identify and perform operations on a web page.

*In case, these locators do not work you can use JavaScriptExecutor. 
You can use JavaScriptExecutor to perform an desired operation on a web element.

*Selenium supports javaScriptExecutor. There is no need for an extra plugin or add-on. 
You just need to import (org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor) in the script as to use JavaScriptExecutor.
